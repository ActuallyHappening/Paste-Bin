# Plan:
This is how it is going to work:

Each house represents a project, with its associated DITUMesh obj ref
Each house mesh will be given its own indicator that it is a project, unlike all of the surrounding houses
This could be:
- An arrow pointing to the house
- A blinking sphere around the house

When a house is clicked, the corresponding project panel will open
