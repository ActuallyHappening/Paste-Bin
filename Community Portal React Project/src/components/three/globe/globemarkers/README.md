# Plan:
the plan with the global markers is to make a HTML element overlay the ditu globe canvas
The HTML element will be referenced through the DITUMesh obj assigned to it
the HTML component will be DITUMesh.markerRef and will be updated through state in the useFrame of the DITUMesh.ref component
this comonent will be in GlobeMarkers.tsx, as without the globe markers.tsx the markers have no meaning

good luck self!
